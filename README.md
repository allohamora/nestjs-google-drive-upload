## Q/A

### Why do I need to share the folder with the service account email?

Service accounts have their own isolated Google Drive storage space. Sharing the folder with the service account email allows you to see the uploaded files in your Google Drive UI. Without sharing, files will still be uploaded successfully but will won't be visible in your Google Drive UI.

Note: If you delete a file from the shared folder in your Google Drive UI, it won't be permanently deleted from the service account's storageâ€”it will only be moved to the trash. To properly delete files, use the API endpoints.
